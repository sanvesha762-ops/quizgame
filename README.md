#  A Quiz Game

## Project Overview
Prompt Quizzer is a simple JavaScript-based quiz game designed to execute entirely within the web browser console. The application loops through a predefined set of questions, accepts user input via prompts, and provides immediate feedback using alerts. This project demonstrates core JavaScript concepts including arrays, loops, conditionals, and functions.

## Features
* **Structured Data:** Questions and answers are stored in an organized array of objects.
* **Input Validation:** User input is processed using `.toLowerCase()` and `.trim()` to handle different capitalizations and accidental spaces.
* **Interactive Feedback:** The game uses `prompt()` to collect answers and `alert()` to provide immediate feedback (Correct/Wrong).
* **Score Tracking:** The application tracks the user's score in real-time and displays the final result upon completion.

## Files Included
* `quiz.js`: The main JavaScript file containing the logic, question array, and `runQuiz()` function.
* `README.md`: Documentation for the project.

## How to Run
Since this program uses browser-specific methods (`prompt` and `alert`), it must be run in a browser environment, not a Node.js terminal.

1.  Open the `quiz.js` file and copy all the code.
2.  Open your web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.).
3.  Open the **Developer Console**:
    * Right-click anywhere on the page and select **Inspect**.
    * Navigate to the **Console** tab.
4.  Paste the copied code into the console area.
5.  Press **Enter** to start the quiz.
